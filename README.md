# RSA_Project_8051
This project implements RSA encryption and decryption on an 8051 microcontroller using UART for input/output. It generates RSA keys, encrypts plaintext using a public key, and decrypts ciphertext with a private key. Features include primality testing, modular exponentiation, and the Extended Euclidean Algorithm for key generation. ðŸš€
